The name is a contraction of resources.expect , which is frequently typed when using this plugin. Motivation The primary use-case is running tests over moderately large datasets where adding them as constants in the test code would be cumbersome. This happens frequently with integration tests or when retrofitting tests onto an existing code-base. If you find your test code being obscured by the test data , filling with complex data generation code, or ad-hoc reading of input data or expected results, then pytest-respect is for you. Installation Install with your favourite package manager such as: pip install pydantic-respect poetry add --dev pydantic-respect uv add --dev pydantic-respect See your package management tool for details, especially on how to install optional extra dependencies. Extras The following extra dependencies are required for additional functionality: poetry - Load, save, and expect pydantic models or arbitrary data through type adapters. numpy - Convert numpy arrays and scalars to python equivalents when generating JSON, both in save and expect. jsonyx - Alternative JSON encoder for semi-compact files, numeric keys, trailing commas, etc. Usage Text Data The simplest use-case is loading textual input data and comparing textual output to an expectation file: def test_translate(resources): input = resources.load_text(\"input\") output = translate(input) resources.expect_text(output, \"output\") If the test is found in a file called foo/test_stuff.py , then it will load the content of foo/test_stuff/test_translate__input.txt , run the translate function on it, and assert that the output exactly matches the content of the file foo/test_stuff/test_translate__output.json . The expectation must also match on trailing spaces and trailing empty lines for the test to pass. Json Data A much more interesting example is doing the same with JSON data: def test_compute(resources): input = resources.load_json(\"input\") output = compute(input) resources.expect_json(output, \"output\") This will load the content of foo/test_stuff/test_compute__input.json , run the compute function on it, and assert that the output exactly matches the content of the file foo/test_stuff/test_compute__output.json . The expectation matching is done on a text representation of the JSON data. This avoids having to parse the expectation files, and allows us to use text-based diff tools, but instead we must avoid other tools reformating the expectations. By default the JSON formatting is by json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2) but see the section on JSON Formatting and Parsing . Pydantic Models With the optional pydantic extra, the same can be done with pydantic data if you have models for your input and output data: def test_compute(resources): input: InputModel = resources.load_pydantic(InputModel, \"input\") output: OutputModel = compute(input) resources.expect_pydantic(output, \"output\") The input and output paths will be identical to the JSON test, since we re-used the name of the test function. TODO: Resource Path Construction To Document: Multiple path parts Default path maker Alternative path makers Custom path makers Failing Tests If an expectation fails, then a new file is created containing the actual value passed to the expect function. Its path is constructed in the same way as that of the expectation file, but with an actual part appended. So in the JSON and Pydantic examples above, it would create the file foo/test_stuff/test_compute__output__actual.json . In addition to this, the normal pytest assert re-writing is done to show the difference between the expected value and the actual value. When the values being compared are more complex, the difference shown on the console may be overwhelming. Then you can instead use your existing diff tools to compare the expected and actual values and perhaps pick individual changes from the actual file before fixing the code to deal with any remaining differences. Once the test passes, the __actual file will be removed. Note that if you change the name of a test after an actual file has been created, then it will have to be deleted manually. Alternatively, if you know that all the actual files from a test run are correct, you can run the test with the --respect-accept flag to update all the expectations. You can also use the --respect-accept-one and --respect-accept-max=n flags to update only a single expectation or the first n expectations before failing on any remaining differences. Parametric Tests The load and expect (and other) methods can take multiple strings for the resource file name parts . In the earlier examples we only used \"input\" and \"output\" parts and failures implicitly added an \"actual\" part. We can pass in as many parts as we like, which nicely brings us to parametric tests: @pytest.mark.paramtrize(\"case\", [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]) def test_compute(resources, case): input = resources.load_json(\"input\", case) output = compute(input) resources.expect_json(output, \"output\", case) Omitting the directory name, this test will load each of test_compute__input__red.json , test_compute__input__green.json , test_compute__input__blue.json and compare the results to test_compute__output__red.json , test_compute__output__green.json , test_compute__output__blue.json Data-driven Parametric Tests We can use the list_resources function to generate a list of resource names to run parametric tests over. With the below fixture, the content of the resource directory is listed, and the fixture is run once for each match. We can then add test cases simply by adding new resource files: @pytest.fixture(params=list_resources(\"widget_*.json\", exclude=[\"*__actual.json\"], strip_ext=True)) def each_widget_name(request) -> str: \"\"\"Request this fixture to run for each widget file in the resource directory.\"\"\" return request.param The list_resources function is run in a static context and so doesn't have a test function or class to build paths from. Instead, it constructs a path to the file that it is called from and uses the pm_only_file path maker by default. However, it takes an optional path_maker argument to override this. Tests can then request each_widget_name to run on each of the resources but will have to use a suitable path-maker to find the resource files: def test_load_json_resource(resources, each_widget_name): widget = resources.load_json(each_widget_name, path_maker=resources.pm_only_file) assert transform(widget) == 42 To Document: Using list function JSON Formatting and Parsing To Document: Default JSON formatter and parser Alternative JSON formatter Jsonyx extension Configuration To Document: Default path makers Default JSON encoder and loader Default ndigits Development Installation Install uv Run uv sync --all-extras Run pre-commit install to enable pre-commit linting. Run pytest to verify installation. Testing This is a pytest plugin so you're expected to know how to run pytest when hacking on it.
